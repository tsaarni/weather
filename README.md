# Examples on how to access weather data from FMI

Finnish Meteorological Institute's open data provides datasets from weather stations. For further information, see [catalog](http://catalog.fmi.fi/geonetwork/srv/fin/catalog.search#/home).

This repository contains examples that show how to access the data in Python and JavaScript.
